in this lecture 

1. we just have seen like how inline and internal CSS works 
    (as we already know how inline works so we had seen internal CSS only.)

2. we learned about selectors.
    now majorly in styleing CSS there is only 3 type of selectors so by using that we can 
    style our entire page 

    a] element selector
    b] class selector
    c] id selector

    we've seen all these example in this HTML doc.
